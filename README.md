Volunteer Organisations dealing with humanitarian catastrophes or major incidents (Like the Red Cross or the Fire brigade) in Germany have not much money - but they have to deal with situations where they need very quick informations about a specific area without having (sufficiant) Internet Access. Normally they have cars with radio communication and that's it.

This Project tries to give them what they need (despite the hardware to run it, of course): A Software to generate and print maps with all the informations in a local database.

Main features:
* Display and print maps from a specific area
* Include user defined layers to display highly customizeable marker (Images and geometric figures)
* Include a search function with a clickable result list to search for streets, places or companies
* Interface for GPS-transmitting mobile radios (Tetra)
* Interface for a special App for smartphones to get GPS data from the whole staff
* Interface to web-editable tables so more than just one admin can import geodata like addresses

I still look for other developers to contribute and I put my work on it as far as I'm hrough to it.
